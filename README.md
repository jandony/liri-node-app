## What is Liri Node App?
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

To retrieve the data that will power this app, the user will send requests _("search")_ using the axios package to the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs.
